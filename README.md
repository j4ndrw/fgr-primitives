# Fine-Grained Reactivity primitives

The goal of this library is, admittedly, a bit ambitious. However, it will serve as a good learning experience when it comes to learning about reactive systems and how we can better design them.

Inspired by [SolidJS](https://github.com/solidjs/solid) and [Leptos](https://github.com/gbj/leptos).
